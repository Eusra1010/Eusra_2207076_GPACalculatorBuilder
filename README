The GPA Calculator Builder is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to help students
easily compute their academic GPA through an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The
application guides users through a structured three-scene workflow: starting from a welcome
page, moving into a detailed course entry form, and finally presenting a comprehensive results
table with the calculated GPA. Users can input course information—including credits, grades,
course code, and instructor names—while the system automatically tracks total credits and
enables GPA calculation only when the required credit threshold is met. With gradient-styled
UI components, smooth scene transitions, validation alerts, and reset functionality, the
project delivers a user-friendly and modern experience tailored for students who want a fast,
clean, and organized way to compute and review their GPA.
